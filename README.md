# MeriSKILL-Internship-Diabetes-Prediction
**Project 2: Diabetes Patients**

In this project, we will explore the dataset of diabetes patients from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal is to develop a predictive model to diagnose diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements. The dataset includes information on female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old.

The dataset contains several independent variables (medical predictor variables) and one dependent variable (outcome). We will analyze the data to understand the relationships between the variables and identify the most important predictors of diabetes. We will then use this information to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a new patient has diabetes.

**Dataset Overview**

The diabetes dataset is a collection of medical records for 768 patients. Each patient has a record that includes information on their age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and other diagnostic measurements. The target variable is whether or not the patient has diabetes.

**Objectives**

The objectives of this project are to:

1. Explore the diabetes dataset and understand the relationships between the variables.
2. Identify the most important predictors of diabetes.
3. Build a machine learning model to predict diabetes.
4. Evaluate the performance of the model.

**Expected Outcomes**

By the end of this project, we will have a better understanding of diabetes and how to predict it using machine learning. We will also have a working machine learning model that can be used to diagnose diabetes in new patients.
